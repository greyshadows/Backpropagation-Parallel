Filenames:

1. act_sigmoid : executed sigmoid function
2. BackProp_Parallel : Backpropagation with 2 sections - Train and Test (This will use the other two files) - Using Parfor
3. BackProp_Parallel2 : Backpropagation with 2 sections - Train and Test (This will use the other two files) â€” Using Parpool
4. dataset : For creating the dataset
5. matrixmultparallel : Naive implementation of matrix multiplication using parfor
6. matrixmultparallel2 : Naive implementation of matrix multiplication using parpool
7. Back_Prop_Parallel_inbuilt : Inbuilt matrix multiplication which is multithreaded
8. parallel1 & parallel2 : Used for further parallelising using parfor 


Instructions:

run BackProp_Parallel.m (or)
run BackProp_Parallel2.m

## You can also run both the sections separately


Thanks ! :)
